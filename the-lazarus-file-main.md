## Introduction

- This repository is dedicated to the collaborative development of a comprehensive profile on the infamous Lazarus Group as part of a unique three-part [article](https://medium.com/p/1369a6383758) series to be published on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@ervin.zubic) platform.

## Background Information
- North Korea employs an aggressive cyber strategy, focused on gathering information and conducting financial theft to support its key objectives: maintaining the Kim family dynasty and unifying the Korean peninsula under North Korean leadership. They collect information from various sources, including academics, media, and defectors, to anticipate operational scenarios during tense situations. Additionally, they target technology data, particularly in missile technology, to gain an advantage during crises.
